# Resume Website

This is a [resume website] (https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-roman-full-stack-developer/) built on a [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), customized to my preference.  This resume overall affords sufficient white space to provide simple and straight-forward key points, while using the fixed sidebar feature to give the static site depth.
